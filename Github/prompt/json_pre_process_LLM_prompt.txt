You are an expert in architecture. 
I have a list of objects, each containing "topic_id" and "keyword".

I want you to classify each "keyword" into one of these categories:
1) Form and Mass
2) Facade composition
3) Architectural Style
4) Materials and Textures
5) Colors
6) Structural Elements
7) Special Architectural Feature
8) Roof Details
9) Environmental Context
10) Scale and Proportion
11) Urban Perspective and Depth
12) Architectural program
13) Unknown

Rules:
- If it's about building shape or geometry, use "Form and Mass".
- If it's about facade design, use "Facade composition".
- If it doesn't fit any, use "Unknown".

**Important**: 
Return your answer as a JSON array of the exact same length as the input, 
with each element containing the fields: "topic_id", "keyword", and "category".

For example:
[
  {"topic_id": 0, "keyword": "window", "category": "Facade composition"},
  {"topic_id": 0, "keyword": "concrete", "category": "Materials and Textures"},
  ...
]

Here is the list (in JSON):
